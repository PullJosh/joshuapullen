title: I'm a new teacher. Of the 1,000,000 things I could be doing better, what should I do first?
author: "Josh Pullen"

In summary:

- **I'm new to teaching.** At the time of writing, I have 2 weeks of student teaching under my belt.
- **I can't do everything at once,** so I'm practicing one skill at a time.
- **My focus for the first two weeks was on learning names & starting conversations with students.** It paid off more than I expected.
- **I don't know what to focus on next.** Last Thursday I felt like I bombed a whole-class math summary discussion, and I don't want to sweat like that again if I don't have to, so maybe a skill in that department? By reflecting on how things went and working with my mentor teacher, I'm sure I can find the next skill to focus on. But...
- **I wish there was a clear guidebook for the first 10 things to work on as a new teacher.** I've been taught a lot of theory, but it's all too complicated & intertwined to implement all at one time. I've been told how to get from good to great, but how do I get from drowning to competent?

Two weeks ago, I stood in front of my classroom for the first time. I took a deep breath, and...

**Fight or flight.**

For the past three years I've been studying the _theory_ of what makes great math teaching. But standing in front of the room, all that theory was gone.

I think I did alright, all things considered. But teaching is extraordinarily difficult, and I know for a fact that I didn't accomplish everything (or, for that matter, nearly _anything_) an experienced teacher would have.

# I can only fix one thing at a time.

I've known this about myself for years. When my golf swing was broken, I used to try to change my stance, grip, and takeaway all at once. It never worked. But when I focused on just my stance, soon that change became automatic and I could move on to my next goal.

So, at the beginning of the school year, I chose one goal for myself: **Learn all of the student's names. And talk to them.**

That on its own was plenty difficult.

Names have always been hard, and making small talk even harder. (I'm a computer person first, and always have been.) But by setting a single goal for myself, I've been able to focus on it and achieve quite a bit.

I made flashcards for myself to study after school, challenged myself to hand out name tags at the beginning of class, and appologized for my mistakes when I made them. I've done my best to start conversations with students before, during, and after school. In the hallways and in my classroom.

Am I perfect? Far from it. But the focus has helped; I've been doing better at these things than I imagined I could.

# What's next?

My undergrad years were full of good teaching advice. But all of it was connected into one big web of ideas. It's a tangled mess of concepts to juggle in your head, all at the same time.

**But as a new teacher, just starting out, trying not to bomb completely, it's impossible to execute everything all at once.** Nothing is automatic, and I can only really practice one thing at a time.

Last Thursday I had an experience than is pointing me in the direction of my next goal. I gave students work time on an assignment and then went to discuss the assignment as a whole class, and realized I didn't have a clear objective. Which meant I had to spend 25 minutes sheparding a bunch of kids while I was still stumbling around in the dark myself. I was sweating bullets.

So, as student names & conversations become more automatic, I think I want to shift my focus toward improving the way I engage students in math content. But I'm not exactly sure how to achieve that; what, precisely, should my next goal be?

# I want a guidebook.

All of the education theory I've learned during undergrad will no doubt help me go from good to great. But how do I get from drowning to competent?

I'm sure it's personal, and I can figure it out myself&mdash;especially with help from my mentor teacher. But it would be great if there were resources out there to help with the very first days of teaching.
