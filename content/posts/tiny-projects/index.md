It is remarkably tempting to take on big projects. But the more I try, the more I fail.

I had one success creating [Rocket Spelling](https://www.rocketspelling.com/), which was—at least by my standards—a big project, which I completed in a single summer. I've been trying to replicate that success for a while, but it isn't working. And I'm becoming convinced that it was a bit of an outlier.

Most of the time, trying to tackle something big all at once just ends in failure. Instead, my most successful work tends to be when I create lots of little things. (Such as when I used to create [Scratch projects](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/PullJosh/projects/) prolifically.)

Specifically, **I think I should focus on ideas that I can complete, from idea to execution to publication, all in one sitting (ideally under an hour).**

Some of these mini projects will suck, but at least I'll be getting _something_ done, rather than finishing nothing.

(For example, this blog post is very short and not particularly exceptional. But I was able to complete and publish it in one sitting, which is a better output than if I had tried and failed to create something bigger and better.)
